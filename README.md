# SP_2020
SOGANG_UNIV_SYSTEM_PROGRAMMING_2020 PROJECT 1~3  
Goal: building ans SIC/XE machine

# Poject 1
Before creating an assembler, linker, loader, we first build a **'Shell'** and a  **'Memory Space'** and finally a **'OPCODE Table'** to invert mnemonic into opcode value.

# Project 2
Implement an **'Assembler'** that can read a assembly program and produce an object file, and a function that can see the **'symbol table'** and **'object file'** that was created during the assembling process

# Project 3
Finally Implement a **'Linker'** and a **'Loader'** that will link the object files that was created during project 2 and load them up on memory that was implemented in project 1
